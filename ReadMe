typedef struct student			
{
	char num[11];				
	char name[20];
	int score[M]; 
	double ave;
}STU;

This is the struct for student, and in my code, I implemented student adding, removing, searching, and displaying. And it can store or load records into or from files.

I finished it when I am a freshman. And now I am a graduate student.
