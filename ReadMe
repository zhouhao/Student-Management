typedef struct student			
{
	char num[11];				//把学号定义成字符数组类型,一来学号可能比较长，二来可直接用strcmp来比较，确保无雷同
	char name[20];
	int score[M]; 
	double ave;
}STU;

This is the struct for student, and in my code, I realized student add, remove, search, display. And it can store or load records into or from files.

I finished it when I am a freshman. And now I am a graduate student.
